 ok you have at least installed these basic programs.
 and now get slackware 14.2 pulseaudio and recompile it
 and you want to recompile alsa-plugins all from slackware 
 repo. We need those built against our new libraries.
 
 first we want to set up set_rlimits
 it is located in your /etc/set_rlimits.conf
 note my set_rlimits.conf-example.in example
 
 In kde you can edit your program qjackctl to start
 
 set_rlimits -r qjackctl
 
note the screen shot Kde-Qjackctl-set_rlimits.png 
in examples

lets start the program qjackctl  
 then click Setup
 

SETTINGS
you can use the screen shots from examples.
first is settings this is my default set up for my head phones.
the device you select is your base device. I use input and out put
to default. if I wanted my out put to be another device then so be it. 

OPTIONS 
Optins does all the work.
pulse-jack-pre-start.sh
pulse-jack-post-start.sh
pulse-jack-pre-stop.sh
pulse-jack-post-stop.sh

Please look at the Qjackctl-Options.png
in examples. 

Now we need the custom asoundrc in my examples. you may copy it to your ~/home folder and name it
.asoundrc note the DOT

ok if everthing is done click start
